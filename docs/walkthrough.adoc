.On necessary operators
====
See link:../README.adoc[] for information on operators and other prerequisites that must be installed for the demo to run properly.
====

== Initial Setup

The following sections review the different windows and potential setup necessary prior to going through the different chapters of this walkthrough.

=== Demo Shell

. Go to the root of the `k8-for-windows-devs` directory on your local machine
. Run this docker command from that directory (so that all the remaining commands will be run from inside a container will all the necessary tools installed)
+
----
docker run -u root -it -v ~/.kube:/opt/app-root/.kube -v ~/.azure:/opt/app-root/.azure -v ~/.ssh:/opt/app-root/.ssh -v $(pwd):/opt/app-root/src quay.io/mhildenb/win-demo-shell:latest /bin/zsh
----

=== Hidden Shell

. Open a shell that is offscreen from the demo that you will use to run background support commands
. Configure this shell as written for <<Demo Shell, the demo shell>>

=== RDP: Windows Workstation

NOTE: This is currently not virtualized is run on a physical windows 10 machine

Configuration points:
* Windows Magnifier On
** kbd:[ctrl+CMD+m] to turn on windows magnifier
** minimize the app
* Visual Studio Community 2019
** FontSizer extension
* Docker for Windows
* WebDeploy?

You will also need to be logged into quay.io for pushing containers to docker

=== RDP: Windows Server

. Find the IP address of the Windows Server (the VM running IIS) by running this command and copying the output
+
----
oc get svc vmrdp -n $vm_prj -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
----
+
. Once in, open IIS Server Manager opened to default website
+

=== Chrome Tabs

. IIS Default Web Site (as hosted by VM)
. OpenShift: Topology view of k8-win-vm
. OpenShift: Admin > Installed Operators > Virtualization Operator of the `openshift-cnv` namespace
. OpenShift: Admin > Compute > Machine Sets
. OpenShift: Gitea 
** Open to this url `echo "https://$(oc get route gitea -n $sup_prj -o jsonpath='{ .spec.host }')/gogs/k8-win-demo-support"`
** Logged in:
*** user: gogs
*** pass: gogs

=== VS Code

. To show some of the yaml files

== Demo: Intro to HPlusSport and Windows Development ==

. In the shell run the follow command to get the url of the repo to clone
+
----
echo "https://$(oc get route gitea -n $sup_prj -o jsonpath='{ .spec.host }')/gogs/k8-win-code-repo.git"
----

.. Type `Windows` in the search bar and select the Windows Framework template
.. Click instantiate template
.. Fill in the template as follows:
*** Windows Container Image: `quay.io/mhildenb/hplussports-win:latest`
*** Web.config Configuration Map Name: `hplus-webconfig`
*** Application Name: `hplus-sports`
*** Route Name: `windows-container`
+
image:windows-container-template.png[]
+
.. Click `Create`
. Show the Windows Container appear in the Topology View
. Take a look at the pod events and highlight that the container cannot be scheduled because *there is no node to run it*

+
. Switch back to the `Developer Perspective` tab we were on before and watch until the pull request is complete
** this will take some time 
. [red]#In the background need to wait for the node to appear so that we can update the pull time#
.. From the `Hidden Shell` run this command to watch for node events
+
----
stern event-display -n $sup_prj
----
+
.. When you see some events come through, then you can break out of the shell and run this command to increase pull times
+
----
oc project $sup_prj
tskr install/kube/tekton/taskrun/run-increase-pull-deadline.yaml
----
+
.. You should see output like this:
+
----

+
----
docker build -t quay.io/mhildenb/hplus-imagesvc:latest . -f .\ImageService\Dockerfile
docker push quay.io/mhildenb/hplus-imagesvc:latest
----
. 
. Switch to the Browser Desktop and select the `Topology View` tab of the $vm_prj
. Select Add container image and fill out based on this:
** image: `quay.io/mhildenb/hplus-imagesvc:latest`
** Runtime Icon: `dotnet`
** Application: `no application group`
** Name: hplus-imagesvc
** Resources: Knative Service
+
image:add-knative-container.png[]
+
. Add the following Environment Variable in `Deployment`
** explain that instead of configmap, dotnet core is more container friendly and lets us specify DB connection strings in Environment
+
----
"ConnectionStrings__ImageDbContext"='Server=hplus-db; Database=HPlusSports; Integrated Security=False; UID=sa; Password=yourStrong(!)Password; MultipleActiveResultSets=true'
----
+
image:knative-deployment.png[]
+
. Hit create and notice it appear in the Topology view
+
. Wait for it to spin down to zero
. Click on the deployment and copy the route
+
image:knative-route.png[]
+
. In the `Demo Shell` paste the URL to set the environment variable `KN_ROUTE`.  Or alternatively use the command below
+
----
# KN_ROUTE=$(kn route describe hplus-imagesvc -n $vm_prj -o jsonpath='{.status.url}')
----
+
. With the Knative service in view run the following command in the shell
+
----
curl -v $KN_ROUTE/api/Images/Category/active-wear-men
----
+
. You should see a redirect to the proper image url

== Demo: Strangle the Monolith

. Switch to the OpenShift: Gitea Tab
. Open the Nginx config file at: `nginx/gateway-conf/nginx.conf`
+
----
GITEA_URL=$(oc get route gitea -n k8-win-support -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo "https://${GITEA_URL}/gogs/k8-win-demo-support/src/branch/master/nginx/gateway-conf/nginx.conf"
----
+
. Highlight the following areas:

+
image:nginx-builder-conf-bc.png[]
+
. Finally click "Create"
+
. Look at the running build by clicking the build badge:
+
image:build-badge.png[]
+
. When the build finishes, go back to topology view.  Nginx gateway should be running (with a blue ring)
. Due to cold start slow startup times, using the *Hidden Shell* update the route for the nginx gateway to timeout after 2m (instead of 60 seconds)
+
----
oc annotate --overwrite route/hplus-gateway 'haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout'='2m' -n $vm_prj
----
+
. Duplicate the tab and move it over to the right where the gateway and knative service can be seen while looking at original tab in full view
. Click on the *Route Badge* on the nginx gateway
. Hit the website twice and notice that a different site is shown each time
** Also notice knative service spinning up
