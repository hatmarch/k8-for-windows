.On necessary operators
====
See link:../README.adoc[] for information on operators and other prerequisites that must be installed for the demo to run properly.
====

== Initial Setup

The following sections review the different windows and potential setup necessary prior to going through the different chapters of this walkthrough.

=== Demo Shell

. Go to the root of the `k8-for-windows-devs` directory on your local machine
. Run this docker command from that directory (so that all the remaining commands will be run from inside a container will all the necessary tools installed)
+
----
docker run -u root -it -v ~/.kube:/opt/app-root/.kube -v ~/.azure:/opt/app-root/.azure -v ~/.ssh:/opt/app-root/.ssh -v $(pwd):/opt/app-root/src quay.io/mhildenb/win-demo-shell:latest /bin/zsh
----
+
. Once in the container run the following to setup environment
+
----
. scripts/shell-setup.sh
----

=== Hidden Shell

. Open a shell that is offscreen from the demo that you will use to run background support commands
. Configure this shell as written for <<Demo Shell, the demo shell>>

=== RDP: Windows Workstation

NOTE: This is currently not virtualized is run on a physical windows 10 machine

=== RDP: Windows Server

. Find the IP address of the Windows Server (the VM running IIS) by running this command and copying the output
+
----
oc get svc vmrdp -n $vm_prj -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
----
+
. Once in, open IIS Server Manager opened to default website
+
image: vm-initial-screen.png[]

=== Chrome Tabs

. IIS Default Web Site (as hosted by VM)
. OpenShift: Topology view of k8-win-vm
. OpenShift: Admin > Installed Operators > Virtualization Operator of the `openshift-cnv` namespace
. OpenShift: Admin > Compute > Machine Sets

=== VS Code

. To show some of the yaml files

== DEMO: Intro to HPlusSport and Windows Development ==

. In the shell run the follow command to get the url of the repo to clone
+
----
echo "https://$(oc get route gitea -n $sup_prj -o jsonpath='{ .spec.host }')/gogs/k8-win-code-repo.git"
----
+
. On the Windows Workstation open Visual Studio 2019 open visual studio and paste in that repo
+
image:vs-code-import.png[]
+
. Change to the HPlusSports Solution view
+
. Start the website by using IIS Express debugging
. Briefly show the site and then stop debugging by closing the web window by clicking the `x`
. Back in the `Solution Explorer` wiew the properties of the website project
+

. [blue]#Update the image by changing `Content\logo.png` to `Content\new-logo.png`#
. Continue showing parts of the site:
** `Features\Home\Index.cshtml`: Point out web.config 
*** [blue]#Add a message as an H1 header (hello from vscode)#
** `Features\Images\ImagesController`: Mention that this is used to lookup images for products
+
. Rerun the website using the debugger
. Show changes then stop build

== Deploy to IIS 

. Start by showing the current IIS server website, which should be the default website
** You can find the URL by running this command in the shell
+
----
echo "http://$(oc get route vm-web -n $vm_prj -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/"
----
+
. You should see this page
+
image:iis-default.png[]
+
. Find the IP address of the WebDeploy service by running this command and copying the output

== Deploy Windows Container to OpenShift: Part 1

. Just as we showed previously, we need to create a configmap that contains the proper configuration for this environment
.. Open the Visual Studio window
.. Use kbd:[cmd+p] to open web.config.k8 quickly
.. Point out items below (and in image):
*** `connectionString`
*** `appSettings`
+
image:relevant-configuration.png[]
+
. From the VSCode terminal issue the following command to upload that configmap to the cluster
+
----
oc create cm hplus-webconfig --from-file=web.config=$DEMO_HOME/k8-dotnet-code/HSport/Website/Web.config.k8 -n $vm_prj
----
. Next show the deployment for the *windows container* we just built locally
.. From the Developer Perspective, create new from catalog
+
image:create-from-catalog.png[]
+
.. Type `Windows` in the search bar and select the Windows Framework template
.. Click instantiate template
.. Fill in the template as follows
*** Windows Container Image: `quay.io/mhildenb/hplussports-win:latest
    required: true 
  - name: WEBCONFIG_CM
    displayName: Web.config Configuration Map Name
    description: The name of the configuration map that includes the web.config that should be used for the windows framework
#    value: hplus-webconfig
    required: true
  - name: APP_NAME
    displayName: Application Name
    description: Unique name for this deployment of the windows image
#    value: hplus-sports
    required: true  
  - name: ROUTE_NAME
    displayName: Route Name
    description: The base name that should be used to create the URL to the container
#    value: "windows-container"
+
image:windows-container-template.png[]
+
.. Click `Create`
. Show the Windows Container appear in the Topology View
. Take a look at the pod events and highlight that the container cannot be scheduled because *there is no node to run it*

== Deploy Windows Container to OpenShift: Part 2: Machine API

. Switch the Administrator View Browser tab
. Select the Compute > Machine Sets and select the win machine set
. Click on the YAML to highlight certain fields (first collapsing the `managedFields` stuff for readability)
+
image:machine-set-highlights.png[]
+
. Then click on Details Tab and click the edit button next to the machine count to change this to 1
+
image:machine-set-count.png[]
+
. Switch back to the `Developer Perspective` tab we were on before and watch until the pull request is complete
** this will take some time 
. [red]#In the background need to wait for the node to appear so that we can update the pull time#
.. From the `Hidden Shell` run this command to watch for node events
+
----
stern event-display -n $sup_prj
----
+
.. When you see some events come through, then you can break out of the shell and run this command to increase pull times
+
----
oc project $sup_prj
tskr install/kube/tekton/taskrun/run-increase-pull-deadline.yaml
----
+
.. You should see output like this:
+
----
